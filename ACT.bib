  abstract = {In most of Argentina, the warming since 1901 was a little lower than the global average, although with strong trends in temperature extremes and in heat waves during the most recent decades. There was a remarkable increase in precipitation over most of subtropical Argentina, especially since 1960. This has favored agriculture yields and the extension of crop lands into semiarid regions, but this increase also came with more frequent heavy rainfalls and consequent flooding of rural and urban areas. Since the early 1970s, the main rivers of the Plata Basin have increased their mean flows, but this was attributable not only to increased precipitation, but also to land use changes. In contrast, over the Andes Mountains, reduced rainfall and increased temperature has led to glaciers receding and reduced river flows. Climate projections for the first half of this century maintain observed trends and raise additional concerns that in most cases can be dealt with timely adaptation policies. However, by the end of this century, under an extreme emissions scenario, the projected warming reaches 3.5°C in the north of the country with respect to present-day conditions. There is insufficient knowledge to assume that this warming would not create severe damages to the people and the economy of Argentina. Because of the damages and casualties that heat waves and extreme precipitation events are already producing, the first and most urgent adaptation required is to reinforce early warning systems and contingency planning to cope with climatic extremes and their consequences on health.For further resources related to this article, please visit the WIREs website.Conflict of interest: The authors have declared no conflicts of interest for this article.},

  abstract = {Land grabbing results in social impacts, injustice, conflict and displacement of smallholders. We use an environmental justice framework to analyse land grabbing and actions taken by local communities (resistance, protest, and proactive organisation). Qualitative research investigating land grabbing for tree plantations and agriculture (primarily soy) was undertaken in Argentina. We found that pre-existing local vulnerabilities tended to result in people acquiescing rather than resisting land grabs. Local people considered existing injustices to be more pressing than land grabbing. Locals tacitly accepted injustice resulting in communities becoming displaced, fenced-in, or evicted. Consequently, already-vulnerable people continue to live in unhealthy conditions, insecure tenure situations, and bear a disproportionate social and environmental burden. More attention should be given to pre-existing vulnerabilities and to improving the wellbeing of people affected by land grabs. Analysing land grabbing from an environmental justice perspective contributes to understanding the deeper reasons about why, where and how land grabbing occurs.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the evolvement of water footprint assessment (WFA) as a new research field over the past fifteen years. The research is rooted in four basic thoughts: (1) there is a global dimension to water management because water-intensive commodities are internationally traded, so we must study virtual water trade and the effects of countries externalizing their water footprint; (2) freshwater renewal rates are limited, so we must study the development of consumption, production and trade patterns in relation to these limitations; (3) supply-chain thinking, previously uncommon in water management, can help to address sustainable water use from the perspective of companies and final consumers; and (4) a comprehensive approach requires the consideration of green in addition to blue water consumption, the traditional focus in water management, and the analysis of water pollution in the same analytical framework as well. The quick emergence of the new field and wide uptake of the water footprint concept in society has generated substantial discussion about what the concept in narrow sense and the research field in broader sense can offer and what not. The paper reflects on the main issues of debate.},

  abstract = {This study quantifies and maps the water footprint (WF) of humanity at a high spatial resolution. It reports on consumptive use of rainwater (green WF) and ground and surface water (blue WF) and volumes of water polluted (gray WF). Water footprints are estimated per nation from both a production and consumption perspective. International virtual water flows are estimated based on trade in agricultural and industrial commodities. The global annual average WF in the period 1996–2005 was 9,087 Gm3/y (74\% green, 11\% blue, 15\% gray). Agricultural production contributes 92\%. About one-fifth of the global WF relates to production for export. The total volume of international virtual water flows related to trade in agricultural and industrial products was 2,320 Gm3/y (68\% green, 13\% blue, 19\% gray). The WF of the global average consumer was 1,385 m3/y. The average consumer in the United States has a WF of 2,842 m3/y, whereas the average citizens in China and India have WFs of 1,071 and 1,089 m3/y, respectively. Consumption of cereal products gives the largest contribution to the WF of the average consumer (27\%), followed by meat (22\%) and milk products (7\%). The volume and pattern of consumption and the WF per ton of product of the products consumed are the main factors determining the WF of a consumer. The study illustrates the global dimension of water consumption and pollution by showing that several countries heavily rely on foreign water resources and that many countries have significant impacts on water consumption and pollution elsewhere.},

  abstract = {The Pampas is among the major agricultural regions in the world; a large proportion of Argentina crop production is originated in this region. The exportation of grain and oil crop represents more than 40\% of the total national exportations. Impact of future climate on wheat, maize and soybean yield and crop adaptation in the Pampas region (60 million hectares) are assessed using climatic inputs generated by CCSM4 climate model (National Center for Atmospheric Research, US). Projections show an increase in the seasonal means maximum and minimum temperature for both the near (2015–2039) and the far (2075–2099) future, as well as a seasonal annual precipitation increase in the near future and a significant increase in the far future with extreme emissions scenarios. In the near future the crop model projects a reduction in wheat yield, an increase in maize yield and a significant increment in soybean yield compared to the regional baseline for moderate (RCP4.5) and extreme (RCP8.5) emissions. In the far future the projection shows a decrease in wheat yield in the RCP4.5 scenario and an increase in the RCP8.5 scenario, maize and soybean shown a yield increase in both scenarios. Adaptation strategies for the near and far future are proposed for wheat and maize that result in up to 45\% yield increases. Adaptation strategies are not proposed for soybean because yield increases were predicted in all scenarios and horizons.},

  abstract = {Nowadays more than 70\% of the fresh water available worldwide is used for agriculture. In Argentina, extensive crops are not usually irrigated, so the cropping production depends mostly on rainfall water. In order to know how many liters of water are needed to produce a ton of soybeans, wheat and maize in the Pergamino district, Province of Buenos Aires, its Water Footprint was estimated by the Hoekstra method. Evaporation and rainfall data was obtained from SIGA INTA platform and production data was obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture. The results indicated that the average annual total water footprint values for soybean, corn and wheat crops for the period 2013-2018 in the Pergamino district, province of Buenos Aires, are 1,388 l∙kg−1, 693 l∙kg−1 and 1,249 l∙kg−1 respectively. These were lower than the global average reference values. The obtained results allowed future analysis advancing in the knowledge of the use of water productivity in grain production.},

  abstract = {Heavily dependent on agriculture, Argentinean stakeholders must prepare to adapt their activities to a different climate. However, the country does not have an agricultural adaptation plan. A space of joint discussion and participatory planning among farmers, scientific researchers, firm managers and government representatives can increase the preparedness to cope with the impacts of climate change. This research uses individual and group interviews to identify perceptions about climate change and possible adaptation strategies suitable for different types of stakeholders of the district of Balcarce. Relatively homogeneous groups of stakeholders perceive an array of weather changes and identify a range of adaptation strategies. This rich set of perceptions and strategies constitute an excellent starting point to define priorities in research and in policy making to implement national, regional, or firm-level adaptation strategies. Genetic techniques, specific scientific knowledge and land-use planning are viewed as promising sources of adaptation and coordination mechanisms. One common request from stakeholders is the coordination between, and within, public and private organizations. Effective adaptation strategies require the implementation multi-level governance and policy integration. However, these integrations will generate benefits in any type of future climate.},

Adverse climatic events such as floods, droughts and frosts can negatively impact the economy of these regions and also affect social composition and stability. In the absence of conscious efforts to adapt, potential increases in the frequency or magnitude of adverse climate events or changes in climate averages (Houghton et al, 2001) may make it more difficult for some producers to participate in the agricultural market. This may be particularly true for small-scale commercial farmers with limited capital, who are not always able to recover from recurrent crop failures.},
